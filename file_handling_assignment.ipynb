And if we are confused regared our code any its exception error then we may pass genric excetion explicity in diffrent except block right after the sepcific defined excetion .\n",

        "    - but on the other side by using with statment we dont have to close the file manully , with statement itself will close our file automaticlly right after the block of code get exicuted , ragardless what opration are bing done over the file after these operation file  will be closed . moreover we will be able to see the update in our file\n",

        "   -  multithreading = In multithreading our process is devided inot multiple threads . here thread is the smallest part of any processor . so in multithreading only one processor/ core is used and over that core when any process of progrmme enters it gets devide  into multiple threads . mean when our process is exicuted over the core/ processor then multiple threads are used . this process is know as multithreading .\n",

        "\n",
        "    - 3. Even logging has levels - info ,dubug , warning , eror , critical . these each level has its own meanning and level stage . debug is considred the lowest level in addtion critical is considred the highest level . so we can log some information in our code on the behalf of above written levels . which helps to understend  code in more easy way .\n",
        "\n",

        "    - memory management = in pytho when we read and write any file that time it is stored in our machine memory by python . memory  managment refers to the process of allocating and rycyling or reallocating the memory of objects . python has dynamic mamory managment system . which handles the most memory relvent task autmaticlly . makes it more easies for the developers to concertrate over writeing code rather then handling memory manully .  \n",
        "    - dynamic memory type\n",
        "    - python uses dynamic memory managment mean varriables data type is determind at runtime\n",

        "    - exception handling - elobration of steps for exception handling\n",
        "    - here first we have to identyfy wheather our code is suspicous or not , and if code is causing error then which type of error we can expect their .\n",
        "    - exception is usully handled by try catch box .\n",
        "    - in try : box we write our code , then our try box will try hard to exicute that code , if not possible then it will cause an excetion error . in this circumstance only our code will enter in except block\n",
        "    - except block : print() - here if try block is returning exception error then exept block will capture that error by using genric excetion parent class and afterwards the print block of code gets exciuted .\n",
        "    - even in except block on the place of genric exception we can define sepcific exception name if we know .\n",
        "    - this is how we can handle any excetion , but there are some other things left ,\n",
        "    - else block - if our code is not suspicous and not throwing exceptional error that time our code must not enter in except block , in this case else block get exicuted , whatver operation we have performed in else block will get exicuted , but not if try block is thowing excetion error and entring in except block .\n",

        "     - in python as we know dynamic mamory managment works . mean all memory mangment is handled by python itself not by any autmatically. we needless to handle memory manully . which makes this language more apprpritate\n",
        "     - naccessty of memory managment = when we write any python varraible so its data get stored at runtime . so later we can access that stored data of that perticuller varraible  again , it,s possible beause of dynamic memory managment .\n",

        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling ?\n",
        "    - try: inside this block always code is written after the code this block trys to exciute the code , if the written code is suspicius and causing any error then try block will throw an exceptional error . eventlly it job is to check the code if not suspicious then exicute it otherwise raise an error .\n",
        "    - except = here usully either specfic excetional name or genric excetion is passed in order to handle the error . if try block thowned an error then that code will enter inside except block , firstly the excptional error will be handled by exception parent class morover the print statement of the class will be exciuted . so this block handle the excption error and exciute the print statment which may include the error massage as well as some sepcific massage .\n",

        "     - python garbage collection system is responsible for managing the memory by freeing up the perticuller memory which is not longer usable . it typcally uses the two macanicism = refrence counting and python garbage collector\n",
        "     - Reference Counting: Each object in Python has a reference count that tracks the number of references to it. When the reference count drops to zero, the memory occupied by the object is deallocated.\n",

Not when try block is raising an and our code in entering inside except block . for easy understending == suppose we are creating any file in try block in wite mode despite file does not exit but new file will be succsufully crearted there in this situation try code will be exicuted and our code must not enter in except block , so here we know else block is going to be exicuted then we can write some data and clse the file , after the code exction both task which has been perfomred inside else block will be exicuted . our file will have some data and file will be in close mode . so we will be able to access our file ..\n",
